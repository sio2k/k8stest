## DevOps Engineer - Tech Test

### Instructions

We believe in `infrastructure as code` and automation of deployments.  We would like you to demonstrate your understanding and use of modern automated infrastructure and sysadmin. To demonstate this, your goal is to provision a simple web application of your choice that has a backend and database store (write a simple app or use an off-the-shelf set of Docker images).  Create an orchestrated cluster of nodes using any provisioning tool of your choice and deploy the application using an orchestration layer (e.g. Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, etc) to scale the application.
